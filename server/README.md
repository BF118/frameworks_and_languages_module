Server
======
Start up instructions:
    Get to the correct directory using cd server
    input: cd server
    once there we need to use a dockerfile to install all the files and
    dependencies that we need. 
    input: make build
    This will build and install all the things you need for the server
    We now need to make it run using our make file 
    Input: make run
    Doing so will start up the server
