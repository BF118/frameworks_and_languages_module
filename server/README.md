Server
======
#Start up instructions:
*    Get to the correct directory using cd server
*   input: cd server
*   once there we need to use a dockerfile to install all the files and
*   dependencies that we need. 
*   input: make build
*   This will build and install all the things you need for the server
*   We now need to make it run using our make file 
*   Input: make run
*   Doing so will start up the server

#Running Locally:
*To run the server locally have to do a similar thing as above
*    Input: cd server
*Then instead of make build and make run we want to input make run_local
*   Input: Make run_local
